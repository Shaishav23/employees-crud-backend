Here I have created APIs usind Node and express.js and I have used Mongodb for database
I have implemented basic CRUD operations where I can do the following things:
GET all employees:"GET" http://localhost:4000/api/employees/ 
CREATE a new employee:"POST" http://localhost:4000/api/employees/
UPDATE an employee:"PATCH" http://localhost:4000/api/employees/Object.id
DELETE an employee:"DELETE" http://localhost:4000/api/employees/Object.id
